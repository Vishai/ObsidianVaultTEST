# About MyriadVault

## Purpose

MyriadVault is a personal knowledge management system designed to capture, organize, and connect ideas across multiple domains of interest. The name "Myriad" reflects the countless connections and insights that emerge when knowledge is properly structured.

## Philosophy

This vault operates on several key principles:

1. **Atomic Notes**: Each note focuses on a single idea or concept
2. **Progressive Summarization**: Information is layered from raw to refined
3. **Linking Over Hierarchy**: Ideas connect across folder boundaries
4. **Future-Proof**: Plain text ensures longevity and portability

- **03_Research**: Deep exploration of specific topics
- **04_Workflows**: Systems and processes
