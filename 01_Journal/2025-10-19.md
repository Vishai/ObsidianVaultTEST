## Morning Reflection

Saturday morning. Taking time to step back and look at the bigger picture. What are we really building here?

## Weekend Projects

- [x] Organized research notes from the past week
- [x] Read through saved articles on RAG systems
- [x] Family time in the afternoon
- [x] Evening walk - captured several voice memos with ideas

## Key Thoughts

The integration between different knowledge domains is where the magic happens. AI research informs theological understanding, which shapes philosophical inquiry, which circles back to better AI implementation.

## Books & Articles

- Started reading "The Alignment Problem" by Brian Christian
- Saved article on retrieval augmented generation for later study
- Re-reading sections of Romans 8 with fresh perspective

## Personal

Grateful for unstructured time to think. The pressure to constantly produce can overshadow the importance of reflection.
