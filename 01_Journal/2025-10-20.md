# Daily Journal - October 20, 2025

## Morning Reflection

Woke up with clarity about the direction of Project Phoenix. The overnight processing seems to have crystallized the approach we need to take. Starting the day with a focused work session on the core architecture.

## Tasks Completed

- [x] Reviewed Project Phoenix documentation
- [x] Created vault structure for MyriadVault
- [x] Team standup meeting
- [x] Research session on prompt engineering techniques
- [ ] Weekly review preparation

## Insights

**On Focus**: Noticed that my best work happens in the first 3 hours of the day. Need to protect this time more aggressively and schedule meetings for afternoon.

**On Learning**: The connection between prompt engineering and theological hermeneutics is fascinating. Both involve careful interpretation and context management.

## Evening Notes

Productive day overall. The structure is coming together nicely. Feeling energized about the possibilities ahead.

Tomorrow's focus: Deep work on Project Avalon design phase.
