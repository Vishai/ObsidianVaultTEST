# Reflections on Focus

## The Challenge

In an age of infinite distraction, maintaining deep focus has become a superpower. But it's not just about blocking out noise - it's about choosing signal.

## What I've Learned

### 1. Focus is Energy Management

Focus isn't unlimited. It's a finite resource that depletes and needs recovery time. Understanding my personal energy rhythms has been transformative:

- **Peak hours**: 6am - 9am
- **Secondary peak**: 2pm - 4pm  
- **Low energy**: 11am - 1pm, after 7pm

### 2. Context Switching is Expensive

Every switch between tasks carries a cognitive cost. The research suggests 20-25 minutes to fully re-engage with deep work after an interruption.

**Solution**: Time blocking and batch processing similar tasks.

### 3. Environment Shapes Attention

Physical space dramatically impacts mental state. My best work happens in:
- Quiet, organized spaces
- Morning natural light
- With specific instrumental music
- Phone in another room

## Practices That Work

1. **Morning Pages**: Julia Cameron's practice of stream-of-consciousness writing clears mental clutter
2. **Pomodoro Technique**: 25-minute focused sprints with 5-minute breaks
3. **Digital Sunset**: No screens after 8pm (still working on this)
4. **Single-Tasking**: One tab, one document, one thing

## The Deeper Question

Why do we struggle with focus? Perhaps because we're unclear about what truly matters. Focus isn't just a technique - it's an expression of values.
