# Project Avalon - Design Notes

## Core Features

### 1. Knowledge Spaces
Organized areas for different research domains. Each space has:
- Core concepts (wiki-style)
- Active discussions (forum-style)
- Resource library
- Member directory

### 2. Quality Mechanisms

**Contribution Scoring**
- Not just upvotes/downvotes
- Weighted by expertise and track record
- Emphasizes thoughtfulness over speed
- Rewards citations and nuance

**Slow Mode**
- Deliberate friction to prevent reactive posting
- Encourage editing and refinement
- Built-in "sleep on it" features

### 3. Discovery Engine

Help users find:
- Related concepts across spaces
- Conversations matching their interests
- Potential collaborators
- Gaps in collective knowledge

### 4. Privacy & Safety

- Pseudonymous by default (optional real names)
- Granular privacy controls
- Strong moderation tools
- Anti-harassment mechanisms

## User Experience

### New Member Journey
1. Interest survey and calibration
2. Guided tour of spaces
3. "Lurk first" encouragement
4. Progressive permissions

### Power User Features
- Advanced search and filtering
- Custom feeds and alerts
- API access for research
- Data export capabilities

## Technical Considerations

- Scalable architecture (start small, grow smart)
- Mobile-responsive but desktop-optimized
- Fast load times critical
- Accessibility as priority
