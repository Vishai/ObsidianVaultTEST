# Project Avalon - Overview

## Vision

Create a community platform that enables collaborative research while maintaining high signal-to-noise ratio through intelligent curation and quality mechanisms.

## The Problem

Online discourse often descends into low-quality noise. Academic platforms are too rigid. Social media is too chaotic. We need something in between.

## The Solution

Project Avalon combines:
- **Structured Knowledge**: Wiki-like organization
- **Community Input**: Reddit-style discussions
- **Quality Curation**: Algorithmic and human-moderated
- **Research Focus**: Built for deep work, not hot takes

## Key Principles

1. **Quality Over Quantity**: Better to have 100 thoughtful members than 10,000 casual users
2. **Intellectual Humility**: Design encourages "I don't know" and changing minds
3. **Cross-Pollination**: Intentionally surface ideas across disciplinary boundaries
4. **Privacy-Respecting**: No unnecessary data collection or surveillance

## Target Audience

- Independent researchers
- Serious learners and autodidacts
- Professionals seeking peer exchange
- Anyone committed to intellectual growth

## Differentiation

Unlike existing platforms:
- Not purely academic (more accessible)
- Not purely social (more structured)
- Not purely wiki (more dynamic)
- Built for synthesis, not just archival
