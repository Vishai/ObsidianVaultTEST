# Project Phoenix - Goals

## Primary Goals

### 1. Automate Connection Discovery
Replace manual linking with intelligent semantic relationship detection. Success = 80% of meaningful connections found automatically.

### 2. Cross-Domain Synthesis
Enable insights that span multiple research areas (AI + Theology + Philosophy). Success = 10+ valuable cross-domain insights per month.

### 3. Accelerate Research
Reduce time from question to insight. Success = 50% reduction in research time for complex questions.

## Secondary Goals

### 4. Knowledge Gap Identification
Highlight areas needing deeper exploration. Success = Quarterly identification of 3-5 promising research directions.

### 5. Passive Learning
System should learn user preferences and improve over time. Success = Increasing relevance of suggestions.

### 6. Privacy-First Design
All processing local or encrypted. Success = Zero compromise on data privacy.

## Non-Goals

- Social features (not a collaboration tool)
- Content creation (suggestions only, not generation)
- General-purpose AI assistant (focused on knowledge synthesis)

## Alignment with Vision

These goals ladder up to the broader vision of augmenting human intelligence rather than replacing it.
