# Project Phoenix - Overview

## Vision

Build an AI-powered knowledge synthesis system that automatically discovers meaningful connections between research notes, identifies patterns across domains, and surfaces insights that would be difficult to find manually.

## Problem Statement

As knowledge bases grow, manual connection-making becomes unsustainable. Information exists in silos, and valuable cross-domain insights remain hidden. Current tools offer linking, but require human identification of relationships.

## Solution

Project Phoenix uses advanced LLM techniques to:
1. Analyze semantic relationships between notes
2. Identify conceptual bridges across different domains
3. Generate synthesis documents highlighting emergent patterns
4. Suggest new research directions based on knowledge gaps

## Core Features

### Phase 1: Foundation âœ…
- Note ingestion and indexing
- Vector embeddings generation
- Basic similarity search

### Phase 2: Intelligence ðŸ”„ (Current)
- Semantic relationship mapping
- Cross-domain connection discovery
- Pattern recognition algorithms

### Phase 3: Synthesis
- Automated insight generation
- Knowledge gap identification
- Research direction suggestions

## Technical Stack

- **Vector DB**: Pinecone or Weaviate
- **LLM**: Claude 4 Sonnet via API
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Automation**: n8n workflows

## Success Metrics

- Number of valuable connections discovered
- Time saved in research process
- Quality of generated insights (subjective)
- User engagement with suggestions
