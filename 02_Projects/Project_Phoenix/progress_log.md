# Project Phoenix - Progress Log

## Week of October 13, 2025

### Completed
- âœ… Finalized vector database selection (going with Pinecone)
- âœ… Set up development environment
- âœ… Created initial data pipeline for note ingestion
- âœ… Tested embedding generation with 100 sample notes

### In Progress
- ðŸ”„ Architecture design for semantic relationship mapping
- ðŸ”„ Prototype of connection scoring algorithm

### Learnings
- Embedding quality is critical; spent time tuning chunking strategy
- Need to handle different note types differently (journal vs research)
- Performance considerations: batch processing vs real-time

### Next Week
- Complete architecture document
- Begin implementation of core relationship engine
- Set up automated testing pipeline

## Week of October 6, 2025

### Completed
- âœ… Requirements gathering and documentation
- âœ… Competitive analysis of existing tools
- âœ… Initial technical spike on vector databases
- âœ… Team alignment meeting

### Challenges
- Scope creep temptation - staying focused on MVP
- Balancing sophistication with speed

## September 2025

### Project Kickoff
