# LLM Agents

## What Are Agents?

LLM agents are autonomous systems that use language models to reason, plan, and take actions toward goals. Unlike simple chatbots, agents can:
- Break down complex tasks
- Use tools and APIs
- Maintain state across interactions
- Learn from feedback

## Core Components

### 1. Reasoning Engine
The LLM itself, responsible for:
- Understanding goals
- Planning steps
- Deciding actions
- Interpreting results

### 2. Memory Systems

**Short-term Memory**
- Current conversation context
- Recent actions and results
- Active goals and plans

**Long-term Memory**
- Past interactions and patterns
- Learned preferences
- Domain knowledge

### 3. Tool Access
Ability to call external functions:
- Web search
- Code execution
- API interactions
- File system operations

### 4. Action Loop
```
1. Observe current state
2. Reason about what to do
3. Select and execute action
4. Evaluate results
5. Update plan if needed
6. Repeat until goal achieved
```

## Agent Architectures

### ReAct (Reason + Act)
Interleaves reasoning and action. Agent explicitly articulates thought process.
### Chain-of-Thought
Forces explicit reasoning steps before action.

### Reflexion
Self-reflection and learning from mistakes.

### AutoGPT Pattern
Autonomous task decomposition and execution.

## Challenges

### 1. Tool Use Reliability
Agents can misuse tools or chain them incorrectly. Requires robust error handling.

### 2. Goal Drift
Long-running agents may lose sight of original objective. Need constant goal checking.

### 3. Hallucination Management
Agents can confidently report false information. Verification mechanisms critical.

### 4. Context Window Limits
Memory constraints require selective information retention.

### 5. Cost Management
Multiple LLM calls can get expensive quickly.

## Applications

- Research assistants
- Coding collaborators
- Task automation
- Data analysis
- Content creation pipelines

## Future Directions

- Multi-agent collaboration
- Improved planning algorithms
- Better memory systems
- Reduced latency
- Lower costs
