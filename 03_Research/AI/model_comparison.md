# Model Comparison

## Current State of LLMs (October 2025)

### Leading Models

**Claude 4 Sonnet (Anthropic)**
- Strengths: Reasoning, coding, following instructions, long context
- Weaknesses: Occasional over-cautiousness
- Best for: Complex analysis, thoughtful dialogue, extended contexts

**GPT-4 (OpenAI)**
- Strengths: General capability, broad knowledge, creativity
- Weaknesses: Can be verbose, occasional hallucinations
- Best for: Wide variety of tasks, creative writing

**Gemini (Google)**
- Strengths: Multimodal, search integration, factual queries
- Weaknesses: Less consistent personality
- Best for: Research, fact-checking, visual tasks

**Llama 3 (Meta)**
- Strengths: Open source, customizable, good performance/cost
- Weaknesses: Requires infrastructure
- Best for: Custom deployments, privacy-critical applications

## Evaluation Dimensions

### Technical Performance
