# Prompt Engineering

## Overview

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing effective inputs for large language models to achieve desired outputs. It's both art and science - requiring understanding of model capabilities, task structure, and iterative refinement.

## Key Principles

### 1. Clarity and Specificity
Vague prompts yield vague results. Be explicit about:
- What you want
- Format of desired output
- Constraints and requirements
- Context needed

### 2. Examples Are Powerful
Few-shot learning works remarkably well. Provide 2-3 examples of desired behavior.

### 3. Think Step-by-Step
Breaking complex tasks into steps improves accuracy dramatically. Use phrases like "Let's approach this systematically" or "Think through this step by step."

### 4. Role Assignment
Assigning an expert role can improve quality: "As an experienced software architect..." or "As a constitutional scholar..."

### 5. Iterative Refinement
First prompt rarely optimal. Test, analyze, adjust.

## Advanced Techniques

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting
Encourage reasoning process visibility:
```
Solve this problem and show your reasoning at each step.
```

### Constitutional AI
Embed principles and constraints:
```
Provide analysis while adhering to: [principles]
```

### Tree of Thoughts
Explore multiple reasoning paths:
```
Generate three different approaches, then evaluate each.
```
