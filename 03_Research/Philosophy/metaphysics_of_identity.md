# Metaphysics of Identity

## Central Question
What constitutes personal identity? What makes you "you" across time and change?

## Historical Perspectives

### Substance Dualism (Descartes)
- Mind and body as separate substances
- "I think, therefore I am"
- Identity rooted in the thinking subject

### Bundle Theory (Hume)
- No persistent self, only bundles of perceptions
- Identity as a convenient fiction
- Challenge: accounting for continuity

### Psychological Continuity (Locke)
- Memory and consciousness as basis of identity
- The thought experiment of the prince and the cobbler
- Problems: false memories, fading memories

## Contemporary Frameworks

### Narrative Identity
- Self as a story we tell
- Integration of past, present, and future
- Character development through time

### Embodied Identity
- Body as essential to selfhood
- Phenomenological considerations
- Disability studies perspectives

## Theological Dimensions

### Imago Dei
- Identity grounded in being image-bearers of God
- Relational ontology
- Eschatological transformation while maintaining continuity

### Resurrection and Identity
- Same person, glorified body
- 1 Corinthians 15:35-58
- Continuity amid radical transformation

## Philosophical Puzzles
1. **Ship of Theseus**: If all parts are replaced, is it the same ship?
2. **Teletransportation**: Would a perfect copy be you?
3. **Split Brain**: What happens to identity when the corpus callosum is severed?

## Practical Implications
- Moral responsibility across time
- Personal transformation and redemption
- End-of-life decisions
- Understanding memory and dementia
