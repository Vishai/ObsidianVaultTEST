# Ontology of Light

## Introduction
Light occupies a unique position in philosophy, theology, and physicsâ€”serving as both a physical phenomenon and a profound metaphor for truth, knowledge, and divine presence.

## Physical Properties

### Wave-Particle Duality
- Light behaves as both wave and particle
- Quantum superposition
- Observer effect in measurement
- Implications for epistemology

### Speed of Light
- Universal constant: c = 299,792,458 m/s
- Nothing travels faster
- Time dilation at relativistic speeds
- Light as cosmic speed limit

## Philosophical Dimensions

### Plato's Cave Allegory
- Shadows vs. reality
- Ascent to the light
- Enlightenment as liberation
- Philosopher-king must return

### Light as Metaphor for Truth
- Illumination and understanding
- Revelation vs. discovery
- Dispelling darkness/ignorance
- Public vs. hidden knowledge

### Phenomenology of Light
- Maurice Merleau-Ponty
- Light makes seeing possible
- Often unnoticed while enabling vision
- Transparency and presence

## Theological Perspectives

### Biblical Foundation
- **Genesis 1:3** - "Let there be light" (before sun and stars)
- **John 1:4-5** - "The light shines in the darkness"
- **John 8:12** - "I am the light of the world"
- **1 John 1:5** - "God is light"

### Uncreated Light
- Divine essence
- Transfiguration (Matthew 17)
- Eastern Orthodox theology
- Distinctions from created light

### Light and Life

- Free will and shadows

### Epistemological Questions
- How do we know we see truly?
- Light as revealer vs. concealer
- Limitations of human perception
- Divine illumination (Augustine, Aquinas)

## Contemporary Applications

### Information Theory
- Light in fiber optics
- Photons carrying data
- Light-speed communication
- Quantum computing

### Light Pollution
- Modern excess
