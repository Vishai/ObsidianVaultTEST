# Stoic Virtue

## Core Principles

### The Four Cardinal Virtues
1. **Wisdom (Sophia)** - Understanding what is truly good
2. **Courage (Andreia)** - Facing challenges with strength
3. **Justice (Dikaiosyne)** - Giving each their due
4. **Temperance (Sophrosyne)** - Self-control and moderation

## Stoic Philosophy Overview

### The Dichotomy of Control
- **In our control**: Judgments, impulses, desires, aversions
- **Not in our control**: Body, property, reputation, status
- Focus energy only on what you can control

### Living According to Nature
- Nature as rational and providential
- Human nature as rational beings
- Virtue as living in harmony with logos
