# Kinsman Redeemer

## Overview
The concept of the kinsman redeemer (Hebrew: *go'el*) is a powerful theological theme throughout Scripture, finding its ultimate fulfillment in Christ.

## Biblical Foundation

### Old Testament Context
- **Leviticus 25:25-28** - Land redemption laws
- **Ruth 3-4** - Boaz as kinsman redeemer
- **Isaiah 59:20** - The Redeemer will come to Zion

### Requirements of a Kinsman Redeemer
1. Must be a blood relative
2. Must be able to pay the price
3. Must be willing to redeem
4. Must be free himself

## Christological Application

### Jesus as Our Kinsman Redeemer
- **Incarnation**: Became human to be our kinsman (Hebrews 2:14-17)
- **Ability**: Had the resources to pay (sinless life, divine nature)
- **Willingness**: Chose to redeem us (Philippians 2:5-8)
- **Freedom**: Not under bondage to sin (Hebrews 4:15)

## Theological Implications
- Demonstrates God's covenant faithfulness
- Shows the necessity of the Incarnation
- Illustrates substitutionary atonement
- Reveals God's redemptive plan from beginning to end
