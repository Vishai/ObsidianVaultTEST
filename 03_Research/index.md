## Cross-Domain Connections

One of the most exciting aspects of research is discovering unexpected bridges between domains:

- AI alignment ↔ Moral philosophy
- Information theory ↔ Theological concepts of logos
- Symbolic systems ↔ Ancient metaphysical frameworks
- Computational thinking ↔ Classical logic

## Research Principles

1. **Follow Curiosity**: Interest is the best guide
2. **Connect Concepts**: Look for patterns across domains
3. **Question Assumptions**: Especially your own
4. **Document Journey**: Capture both insights and confusions
5. **Share Generously**: Knowledge compounds through sharing

## Current Questions

- How does retrieval augmented generation change research methodology?
- What can ancient theological metaphysics teach us about modern AI alignment?
- How do different philosophical frameworks shape our approach to technology?
