**Idea:** Integration between AI agents and personal knowledge management  
Could create a system where AI agents have context from entire vault, enabling more intelligent assistance with projects and research.

**Observation:** The value of atomic notes  
Breaking down complex ideas into atomic units makes it easier to recombine and synthesize new insights.

**Question:** How does RAG compare to fine-tuning for domain-specific applications?  
Need to research trade-offs. RAG seems more flexible but may have latency issues.

**Insight:** Symbolic language bridges technical and theological thinking  
Both domains use symbolic systems to represent complex realities. [[03_Research/Philosophy/symbolic_language]]

## Earlier Notes

**Workflow Improvement:** Use templates more consistently  
Creating standard templates saves time and ensures completeness.

**Philosophy:** Identity and continuity through change  
What makes something "the same" across transformation? Ship of Theseus paradox.

**Technical:** Prompt engineering as a new form of programming  
Instead of explicit instructions, we guide through examples and conversation.
