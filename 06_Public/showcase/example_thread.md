## Example: AI Prompt Engineering

ðŸ§µ **1/8** Most people are using AI wrong. Here's how to get 10x better results with better prompts:

**2/8** The problem: Generic prompts get generic results. "Write me a blog post" gives you mediocre content that needs heavy editing.

**3/8** Why this happens: AI models respond to specificity. They need context, constraints, and examples to produce quality output.

**4/8** Insight #1: Use role-based prompting. "You are an expert technical writer..." sets the tone and expertise level.

**5/8** Insight #2: Provide structure. Give the AI an outline or format to follow. Show examples of what "good" looks like.

**6/8** Insight #3: Iterate conversationally. Don't expect perfection on the first try. Refine through dialogue.

**7/8** Action: Try this template:
- Role: "You are a [expert]..."
- Task: "Create a [specific output]..."
- Context: "For [audience] who needs [outcome]..."
- Constraints: "Using [format], keep it [length]"
- Example: [show sample]

**8/8** Master this and you'll save hours while producing better content. The key isn't the AIâ€”it's how you communicate with it.
