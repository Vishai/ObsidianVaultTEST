But it's not just about blocking out noise - it's about choosing signal.Focus isn't unlimited. It's a finite resource that depletes and needs recovery time. Understanding my personal energy rhythms has been transformative:\nPeak hours: 6am - 9am\nSecondary peak: 2pm - 4pm Low energy: 11am - 1pm, after 7pm\nEvery switch between tasks carries a cognitive cost. The research suggests 20-25 minutes to fully re-engage with deep work after an interruption.Solution: Time blocking and batch processing similar tasks.Physical space dramatically impacts mental state. My best work happens in:\nQuiet, organized spaces\nMorning natural light\nWith specific instrumental music\nPhone in another room Morning Pages: Julia Cameron's practice of stream-of-consciousness writing clears mental clutter\nPomodoro Technique: 25-minute focused sprints with 5-minute breaks\nDigital Sunset: No screens after 8pm (still working on this)\nSingle-Tasking: One tab, one document, one thing\nWhy do we struggle with focus? Perhaps because we're unclear about what truly matters.

Verification mechanisms critical.Memory constraints require selective information retention.Multiple LLM calls can get expensive quickly.\nResearch assistants\nCoding collaborators\nTask automation\nData analysis\nContent creation pipelines Multi-agent collaboration\nImproved planning algorithms\nBetter memory systems\nReduced latency\nLower costs\nRelated: <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"prompt_engineering\" data-href=\"prompt_engineering\" href=\"03_research/ai/prompt_engineering.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Prompt Engineering</a> | <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"retrieval_augmented_generation\" data-href=\"retrieval_augmented_generation\" href=\"03_research/ai/retrieval_augmented_generation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">RAG</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"LLM Agents","level":1,"id":"LLM_Agents_0"},{"heading":"What Are Agents?","level":2,"id":"What_Are_Agents?_0"},{"heading":"Core Components","level":2,"id":"Core_Components_0"},{"heading":"1.

Babylonian creation myth tells of Marduk's battle with Tiamat, the primordial chaos dragon. This isn't merely ancient mythology - it's a sophisticated metaphysical framework.\nPrimordial chaos\nSalt water (feminine principle)\nUndifferentiated potential\nMother of gods Order and sovereignty\nStorm god\nDivine warrior\nCreator through conquest\nMarduk slays Tiamat and splits her body to create heaven and earth. From chaos comes order. From undifferentiated potential comes structured reality.Unlike Genesis's \"speaking into being,\" Enuma Elish presents creation as violent ordering of chaos. This pattern echoes throughout ancient Near Eastern thought.Marduk's victory establishes divine sovereignty. Order isn't inherent - it's won, maintained, defended.Tiamat is split, not annihilated. Chaos remains part of cosmic structure. Order contains and shapes chaos rather than eliminating it.\nLeviathan and Rahab (chaos monsters)\nGod's sovereignty over waters\nCreation by divine word (different method, similar result) Logos bringing order from chaos\nChrist's cosmic victory\nNew creation from old\nPsychological\nMarduk as conscious ego, Tiamat as unconscious chaos. Individuation requires integrating shadow.Political\nMyth legitimizes authority structure. Divine mandate for earthly kingship.Cosmological\nAncient science in mythic form. How does order emerge from disorder?The tension between order and chaos isn't resolved by elimination but by creative structuring. This resonates with:\nInformation theory (entropy vs organization)\nComplexity science (emergence of order)\nCreative process (form from formlessness)\nPerhaps the deepest truth in this myth: creation is ongoing. Order must be continually renewed against entropy.\nHow does this relate to other creation-through-conflict myths?\nWhat's the relationship between political power and creation theology?\nCan we read this ecologically - order vs chaos in nature?\nRelated: <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"tree_of_life_genetics\" data-href=\"tree_of_life_genetics\" href=\"03_research/theology/tree_of_life_genetics.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tree of Life</a> | <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"../Philosophy/metaphysics_of_identity\" data-href=\"../Philosophy/metaphysics_of_identity\" href=\"03_research/philosophy/metaphysics_of_identity.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Metaphysics</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Marduk and Tiamat","level":1,"id":"Marduk_and_Tiamat_0"},{"heading":"The Enuma Elish Narrative","level":2,"id":"The_Enuma_Elish_Narrative_0"},{"heading":"The Players","level":2,"id":"The_Players_0"},{"heading":"Tiamat","level":3,"id":"Tiamat_0"},{"heading":"Marduk","level":3,"id":"Marduk_0"},{"heading":"The Battle","level":2,"id":"The_Battle_0"},{"heading":"Theological Significance","level":2,"id":"Theological_Significance_0"},{"heading":"Creation Through Conflict","level":3,"id":"Creation_Through_Conflict_0"},{"heading":"Sovereignty Established","level":3,"id":"Sovereignty_Established_0"},{"heading":"Chaos Not Destroyed","level":3,"id":"Chaos_Not_Destroyed_0"},{"heading":"Parallels and Contrasts","level":2,"id":"Parallels_and_Contrasts_0"},{"heading":"Hebrew Bible","level":3,"id":"Hebrew_Bible_0"},{"heading":"Christian Theology","level":3,"id":"Christian_Theology_0"},{"heading":"Modern Interpretations","level":2,"id":"Modern_Interpretations_0"},{"heading":"Personal Reflections","level":2,"id":"Personal_Reflections_0"},{"heading":"Questions for Further Study","level":2,"id":"Questions_for_Further_Study_0"}],"links":["03_research/theology/tree_of_life_genetics.html","03_research/philosophy/metaphysics_of_identity.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"03_research/theology/marduk_and_tiamat.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1760976301721,"modifiedTime":1760976312213,"sourceSize":2466,"sourcePath":"03_Research/Theology/marduk_and_tiamat.md","exportPath":"03_research/theology/marduk_and_tiamat.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":37,"backlinks":["03_research/theology/tree_of_life_genetics.html"],"type":"markdown"},"03_research/theology/romans_8_commentary.html":{"title":"romans_8_commentary","icon":"","description":"Romans 8 is considered by many to be the theological pinnacle of Paul's letter to the Romans. After establishing justification by faith (chapters 1-5) and wrestling with sin and law (chapters 6-7), chapter 8 explodes with hope.No Condemnation (v1)\n\"There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.\"This isn't moral relativism - it's completed justification. The verdict is in, and it's favorable. Not because of merit, but because of Christ.Spirit vs Flesh (v5-8)\nNot body vs soul dualism. \"Flesh\" (sarx) means human effort and self-reliance. \"Spirit\" means divine empowerment and dependence on God.Adoption (v15-17)\nWe're not just servants but children. \"Abba\" - intimate family language.

Suffering that leads to newness. Not arbitrary but transformative.Hope\nWe hope for what we don't yet see. Faith bridges present pain and future glory.Even prayer is beyond us. The Spirit translates our inarticulate longing into communication with God.All Things Work Together\nNot \"everything happens for a reason\" (cheap fatalism). Rather: God can work redemptively with anything, even tragedy.Predestination\nControversial. Corporate election? Individual predetermination? Both? Neither? Mystery remains.Golden Chain\nForeknew → Predestined → Called → Justified → Glorified. Notice past tense even for future events.

Here's how to get 10x better results with better prompts:2/8 The problem: Generic prompts get generic results. \"Write me a blog post\" gives you mediocre content that needs heavy editing.3/8 Why this happens: AI models respond to specificity. They need context, constraints, and examples to produce quality output.4/8 Insight #1: Use role-based prompting. \"You are an expert technical writer...\" sets the tone and expertise level.5/8 Insight #2: Provide structure. Give the AI an outline or format to follow. Show examples of what \"good\" looks like.6/8 Insight #3: Iterate conversationally. Don't expect perfection on the first try. Refine through dialogue.7/8 Action: Try this template:\nRole: \"You are a [expert]...\"\nTask: \"Create a [specific output]...\"\nContext: \"For [audience] who needs [outcome]...\"\nConstraints: \"Using [format], keep it [length]\"\nExample: [show sample]\n8/8 Master this and you'll save hours while producing better content.
